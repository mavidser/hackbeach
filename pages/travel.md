Madgaon
: is a Major railway station in Goa. Its about 35kms from the Goa Airport. You can go to the nearest bus station by taxi, or take a bus to Madgaon. 

_Important_: Just be sure to reach Madgaon Railway Station from GOI (airport) well before night (around 10pm) if you plan to take the bus, since they usually stop running at night.

## By Bus

### From Goa

**Bus Route** : Goa - (Madgao) - Karwar - Ankola/Madangeri - Gokarna.

- Take a bus from Goa (Madgao) to Karwar (frequent buses start from 6am).
- Take a bus from Karwar that goes to Kumta, and get down at Ankola/Madangeri.
- Take a local bus from there to Gokarna
- You can walk/get a cab to Gokarna beach from the Gokarna bus stand

(If you get a Kumta bus from Goa, that's perfect, you can avoid the second step)

Just keep saying 'Gokarna' to the bus conductors and they will hop you in and drop you out from where you will get the next bus to Gokarna. Its an interesting journey to do in the day if you have about 4-6 hours to spare.
